UPDATE: added the solution we wrote together on Sunday with comments, also added a package named "solution" in the second task that we didn't have time to do.

In the second task the original implementation has comments about what could be wrong in the code, the solution has comments about how this is better :)

# Pink Workshop

Santa is hiring Java developers!

Hello and Welcome to our workshop on the 3rd of December! We will be looking at interview-style coding tasks in Java,
discussing some bad solution examples, and writing awesome code that would impress even the pickiest interviewer :)

Please prepare for the workshop by following the steps below.

### Setup

1. You will need Java on your computer, you can download JDK 17
   here: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html

2. I will be using IntelliJ during the workshop, but any of the following editors can do the job :)
    * IntelliJ: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows
    * Eclipse: https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/
    * Visual Studio Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/download

3. Clone this repository!

4. Open the project in your code editor, and please make sure you can compile and run it (find one of the Main classes
   in the project, you should be able to run the main methods there)

### The workshop

During the workshop we will look at the two tasks in this project, Santa's Pocket and Secret Santa. The example
implementations you find here are intentionally not the best :) During the workshop we will discuss what is it
exactly that an interviewer wouldn't like - highlighting what is excepted from a beginner, and what could be considered
for intermediate/senior levels - and we will rewrite the tasks using a more modern and efficient Java-style :)
